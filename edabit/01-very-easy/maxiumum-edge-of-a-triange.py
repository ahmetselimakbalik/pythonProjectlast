"""
Maximum Edge of a Triangle
Create a function that finds the maximum range of a triangle's third edge, where the side lengths are all integers.

Examples
next_edge(8, 10) ➞ 17

next_edge(5, 7) ➞ 11

next_edge(9, 2) ➞ 10
Notes
(side1 + side2) - 1 = maximum range of third edge.
The side lengths of the triangle are positive integers.
Don't forget to return the result.
